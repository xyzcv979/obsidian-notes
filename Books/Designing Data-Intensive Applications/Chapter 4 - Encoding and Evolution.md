Applications are always changing. How do we deal with when data changes? Different data schemas will be required. 2 ways to handle this:
- Backwards compatibility
	- newer code can still read data from old code
- Forward compatibility
	- make old code read data written by new code

This chapter will dive into different formats for encoding data:
- JSON
- XML
- Protocol Buffer
- Thrift
- Avro

Then, discuss how those formats are used for data storage and communication
- REST (representational state transfer)
- RPC (remote procedural call)
- message passing systems like message queues
