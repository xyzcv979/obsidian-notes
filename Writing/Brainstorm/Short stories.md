A knight on the way to war. Dark world, no hope, warhammer inspired, 

I walk towards war. Today King George's forces lay siege against Baron John, the traitor, heretic. I am Sergeant Alex, of the 3rd Legion, the Iron Wolves, 2nd company. 30 year old, a seasoned veteran of many battles.

I am tired. I am tired shitting in the woods. I am tired of eating raw grains. I havent eaten meat in months. I am cold, wet, tired, hungry, and miserable. I march against a traitor who I care nothing for. This battle does not matter to me.

Yet I march. Because I dont have a choice. I chose the profession of arms because life isnt fair to poor orphans. Only the war machine was willing to take me in. I am the lowest of the low but surprisingly adequate at the blade, and so I march to my doom. Besides me is the team I lead. Younglings, all of them. They wont live another month, but I'll do everything I can to lead them to victory. 

We march now 2 miles from the castle. Scout platoons have already established forward operating posts and markers for siege emplacement. The Baron is surrounded. It's eastern back faces the ocean. The north is a grand mountain top. We come from the south west and have some 30000 troops to enclose the castle. I enjoy sieges the most because I can sit around for days until the poor bastards start starving to death or are inflicted with disease. 

We Iron Wolves are tenacious bastards. Our strength comes from our formidable cavalary and mounted bowmen. We are agile, fierce, and strong. There are a total of 20 legions under the King before the civil war. 8 of them have turned traitor and enacted their treasonous plan on the Day of the Reckoning. They tricked and betrayed the other legions and surrounded and slaughtered 4 legions worth of soldiers. 8 loyalist legions remain and we are determined to slaugther the traitor legions. But this war has been going on for 5 years with no end in sight. Neighboring nations have taken advantage of the situation and wont hesitate to  swoop in for the pickings. The land of the sun to the east, the chaos tribes to the south, the wanderers to the north, and the Black Empire to the west.

The United Kingdom lays in strife with the civil war. No one else is more to blame for this conflict than the leader of the traitors, Duke Augustus, leader of the 1st legion, first born of the King. Augustus poisoned and murdered his fellow brothers in an attempt to claim the throne. The King furious over this stripped him of all titles, land, and fiefdoms. Unbenowst to him, Augustus had many backers that are looking for a new age in royalty. 

But what do I know, Im just a soldier, not even a knight of prestige and renown. I fight for the King cause else how am I gonna get paid?
