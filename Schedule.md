**Tips:**
- Prioritize tasks based on your goals. If you're preparing for job interviews, allocate more time to LeetCode. If you're focused on personal projects, allocate more time to coding.
- Use Pomodoro technique (e.g., 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break) to maintain productivity.
- Set specific, achievable goals for each session.
- Adapt the schedule as needed. Life happens, and flexibility is essential.
- Ensure you get enough rest. Consistent sleep is crucial for effective learning and problem-solving.
