## Introduction
"Tell me about yourself"
Thank you for this opportunity. My name is Alexander, or Alex. I graduated from Columbia University, last year, with a bachelors degree in computer science and I'm particularly interested in distributed systems, because I think it is fun, interesting, and challenging to learn about how systems scale, are fault tolerant, and stay available.

Before pursuing my degree, I spent four years in the United States Army, serving with the Special Operations unit, 75th Ranger Regiment, and graduating from the rigorous leadership school, Ranger school. This experience exposed me to leadership, teamwork, discipline, resilience and the ability to handle high physical and mental stress.

Currently I am a software engineer at Walmart, where I’ve gained experience with software development and data engineering. I am apart of a team for a product that does finance forecasting, a tool for Walmart finance business users to use for forecasting, predictions which helps with long range planning. Specifically I work with the services and pipelines that handle finance data, services like automating pipelines with events, identifying where we can make our architecture more robust by adding quality checks. I am interested in backend development, but I learn frontend on my free time so that I have the skills to create any fullstack application I want.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work at Amazon because of the scale and impact of the problems it tackles. I want to write code with value and high business impact that is used by millions of users worldwide. As mentioned before, I like learning about distributed systems so I believe Amazon have opportunities for me to get hands on experience with them. The chance to grow professionally while solving complex, large-scale problems at Amazon is incredibly motivating to me.

Outside of work, I enjoy building and painting warhammer miniatures, which taps into my creative side and helps me stay balanced. And I like sports and working out alot which keeps my mind and body healthy

Thank you again for this opportunity. I look forward to showcasing my skills and experiences.

## Leadership principles
### Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

Sample questions:
- **Can you tell me about a time when you took the initiative to learn something new that was not directly related to your job? How did you apply this new knowledge?**
- **Describe a situation where your curiosity led you to explore a new idea or technology. What was the outcome?**
- **Give an example of a time when you had to quickly learn something new to solve a problem. How did you approach the learning process?**
- **Tell me about an important lesson you learned over the past year.**
- **Tell me about a situation or experience you went through that changed your way of thinking.**
- **Tell me about a time when you made a smarter decision with the help of your curiosity**

Example:
- What is the coolest thing you have learned on your own that has helped you better perform your job?
	- Situation/Task: I'm a backend developer. This example is not related to work that I had assigned on my team but I got to experience something new because of my curiosity. We wanted to refactor one of our legacy applications. My team already knew how to do that for the backend, but there were still discussions on the front-end team as the best way to do it. So they scheduled a meeting to discuss it. 
	- Action: Even though I didn't know anything about front-end I decided it could be nice to participate, learn something new, and help others improve as well. So I spent the previous week before the meeting learning about the existing architecture, frontend refactors in our company and front end tech (NodeJS and React). I saw another frontend architecture in our company, written in NodeJS, was taking alot of time to be deployed because they had to install alot of npm dependnecies
	- Result: When the time to discuss arrived, team proposed to use NodeJS. I explained the cons I saw, especially regarding deployment times, and proposed to use React. They didn't know React so I gave them a quick dmeo. They agreed to use it and offered me to be part of the frontend team for this refactor. I moved to work with them for a couple of months, and we successfully implemented it. It was great because I learned about frontend and React, and I was able to apply that knowledge to practice.
	- What makes this a strong 'learn and be curious' example?
		- In this example, the candidate shows the following strength behaviors:
			- The candidate went beyond their day-to-day work to learn new technologies (front-end, React, NodeJS). Doing it in their free time and even using it to help the other team select the best architecture for the refactor.
			- They went out of their comfort zone, learned new things (external technology and front-end architectures in the company) and applied them to practice.
- **Question:** Can you tell me about a time when you took the initiative to learn something new that was not directly related to your job? How did you apply this new knowledge?
	- **Answer:**
		- **Situation:** In my previous role, our company started to expand into cloud computing, but I had no prior experience in this area.
		- **Task:** I decided to take the initiative to learn more about cloud technologies, even though it was not part of my current responsibilities.
		- **Action:** I enrolled in an online course on cloud computing, attended webinars, and participated in a cloud technology community forum. I also completed several hands-on projects to solidify my understanding.
		- **Result:** My new knowledge allowed me to suggest and implement a cloud-based solution for our data storage, which significantly improved data access speed and reduced costs by 20%. This proactive learning also led to my involvement in more strategic projects related to cloud technologies.
### Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job".

Sample questions:
- **Tell me about a time when you took ownership of a project or task that was outside of your usual responsibilities. What actions did you take and what was the result?**
- **Describe a situation where you identified a problem within your team or organization and took the initiative to fix it. What steps did you take?**
- **Can you provide an example of a time when you had to make a difficult decision on a project without having all the necessary information? How did you handle it?**
- **Tell me about a time when you had to work on a task with unclear responsibilities.**
- **Tell me about a time when you showed an initiative to work on a challenging project**

Example:
- **Question**: Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?
	- Situation/Task: A couple of months ago I attended a business meeting just to hear how our company was doing. They raised that the conversion rate between paid and free users was not as good as expected. As my team owns the front-end, I felt responsible for that space. Even though nobody asked me to do something about it, when the meeting finished, I tried to check if there was any technical explanation to it.
	- Action: I checked our customer metrics and Google analytics, focusing on the difference between both flows. I realized that some particular flows and buttons that result in monetary benefits were not used at all by customers. I suspected the cause was the UI design's lack of clarity and proposed some UX changes to those flows
	- Result: I presented those proposals to the business with my justification, requesting to do an AB test to check if those would improve conversion. They accepted it. I ran the AB tests and saw that the conversion improved from 5% to 9% with one of the changes, so we deployed the changes
	- What makes this a strong 'ownership' example?
		- In this example, the candidate shows the following strength behaviors:
			- The candidate clearly structured the explanation, following the STAR model. It is clear what action they took.
			- They took ownership of a business problem related to their team domain (front-end), even though they weren't asked to look into the issue.
			- The candidate completed actions end-to-end. They took ownership of root causing, designing a proposal, convincing business, doing AB testing and releasing the change.
			- The impact of the candidate's action is clear; there is an improvement over the previous conversion rate.
- **Question:** Tell me about a time when you took ownership of a project or task that was outside of your usual responsibilities. What actions did you take and what was the result?
	- **Answer:**
		- **Situation:** During a product launch, our project manager fell ill, leaving a leadership gap at a critical time.
		- **Task:** I took ownership of the project management role to ensure the product launch stayed on track.
		- **Action:** I organized daily stand-up meetings, reallocated tasks based on team members’ strengths, and maintained close communication with stakeholders. I also monitored the project timeline and addressed any issues promptly.
		- **Result:** The product was launched on time and received positive feedback from customers. My initiative ensured the project’s success and demonstrated my capability to handle unexpected responsibilities effectively.
### Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

Sample questions
- **Describe a project where you had to deliver significant results under a tight deadline. How did you ensure the project was completed on time?**
- **Tell me about a time when you set a challenging goal for yourself or your team. What was the goal and what was the outcome?**
- **Give an example of a time when you faced significant obstacles in achieving your objectives. How did you overcome these obstacles and what were the results?**
- **Describe the most challenging situation in your life and how you handled it.**
- **Give an example of a time when you had to handle a variety of assignments. What was the outcome?**
- **Tell me about a time when your team gave up on something, but you pushed them to deliver results.**

Example:
- Tell me about a time when you delivered an important project under a tight deadline. What sacrifices did you have to make to meet the deadline? How did they impact the final deliverable? What was the final outcome?
	- Situation: My team was under pressure to deliver a project in 6 months
	- Task: Our initial technical estimations pointed out we needed three extra months to finish everything, so we deiced we needed to cut things off, prioritize the critical paths or find ways to simplify the project
	- Action: Given the features we had to implement couldn't be reduced in number, I did two things: 
		- I saw testing would take us more time, so I started seeing feature prioritization and build a test plan for the project accordingly. Once I had it, I marked what tests we could postpone because they were repeated or checked at other levels (usuability testing, b/c we had to run end to end testing) or UI automation or certain features, as we were going to implement JS unit test cases. I also suggested reducing accessibility tests, running just a subset of it for the first release, then the rest later.
		- Whenever we had to implement a feature, I encouraged my team mates to think if we could reuse existing code or systems to simplify the implementation and reduce time. For example, I remember we had to add a feature where customers can buy products in a  physical store that are out of stock: they will pay them at the store and get them sent to their house. I realized we already had a feature that allowed customers to buy products in the physical store with coupons, we were later sending them the products. This flow fit nicely with that feature, we only had to implement a mechanism for customers to "buy the coupons" in the background, when they come to the cashier. This simplified development by several weeks.
	- Result: I checked both proposals with the project owner and acted as bridge between them and my team to share our progress and obstacles every week. We were able to deliver with only one week delay (vs the estimated 12 weeks) without affecting quality of the features we delivered. We ran the remaining tests and automation in another release
	- What makes this a strong 'deliver results' example?
		- In this example, the candidate shows the following strength behaviors:
			- Even though they saw the deadline was too tight, they tried to find ways of delivering the project on time with the right quality (focused on simplifying and removing already covered items).
			- They communicated and agreed to all simplifications with the project owner. 
			- They decided to act as the bridge with the project owner and share the status of the project.
- **Question:** Describe a project where you had to deliver significant results under a tight deadline. How did you ensure the project was completed on time?
	- **Answer:**
		- **Situation:** Our team was assigned to develop a new feature for our product with a tight two-month deadline.
		- **Task:** I was responsible for leading the development and ensuring timely delivery.
		- **Action:** I broke down the project into smaller tasks and set clear milestones. Implemented agile practices such as daily stand-ups and bi-weekly sprints to track progress. I also worked closely with the QA team to integrate continuous testing.
		- **Result:** We delivered the feature ahead of schedule, and it exceeded performance expectations. The successful delivery boosted the product’s competitiveness and generated positive stakeholder feedback.
