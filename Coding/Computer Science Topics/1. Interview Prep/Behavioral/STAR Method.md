**Situation** - Provide context and background for the situation that you were in. You must describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description. This example can be from a previous job, school project, volunteer activity, or any relevant event. Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand the complexities of the situation.

**Task** - Describe the task that you needed to accomplish. What goal were you working toward? Be sure to consider quantitative and qualitative goals.

**Action** - Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail, and keep the focus on you. 
What specific steps did you take? What was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project. Let us know what you actually did. 
Use the word “I,” not “we,” when describing actions.

**Result** - Describe the outcomes of your actions and don't be shy about taking credit for your behavior.   You should be able to answer:  What happened? How did you measure success? What results did achieve? What trade-offs did you have to make to achieve this? What did you learn or would have done differently? 
Examples of metrics:
- Cost savings, revenue generation
- Quantify to understand volume, size, scale
- Percentage change, year over year improvements
- Time to market, implementation time, time savings
- Impact on the customer, the team
- Quality improvements


### STAR Method

STAR stands for "**Situation - Task - Action - Results**".

For example, in behavioral interview questions like this, you could easily employ the STAR method for a complete answer:

_"Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision, which included short-term sacrifices for longer-term goals._"

**Situation.** Begin by briefly talking about the context and situation:

_"I was once managing a website, and it suddenly started showing slow performance due to a mistake on our side that went unnoticed for a long time. As a project manager, I took full responsibility and worked with the engineering team to resolve the issue promptly."_

**Task** - Elaborate on the necessary tasks involved in the resolution of a situation:

_"This mistake has shown me how important it is to monitor non-functional requirements in addition to the development of new features, on which I was spending most of my time."_

**Action** - Describe all the steps you took to complete the above tasks:

_"After fixing the issue, I made sure that such mistake doesn't happen again: I have implemented a good application management tool and set up to receive email alerts when website behavior exceeds set SLAs or thresholds. I spent the time to learn the tool myself to analyze previous issues further."_

**Results** - Talk about the consequences or outcome of the situation and your actions:

_"With these actions, we were able to have consistent page load times under 3 seconds. I also shared my experience with other project managers in the team through a brown bag presentation to prevent the situation from happening again."_

### CAR Method

The CAR technique of answering Amazon Leadership Principles interview questions is very similar to STAR.

CAR stands for "**Context - Action - Result**".

Let's take a look at this Amazon Leadership Principles question:

_"Tell me about a time when you had to deliver results in the face of challenges."_

Following the CAR method, you would answer the following way:

**Context** - Set the scene and describe the situation of a relevant example from your past experiences:

_"In my previous employment, the sales division has been experiencing decreasing sales. I was invited to help reverse the situation. The biggest challenge I faced was to manage the team effectively so that they can not only meet but exceed their sales targets."_

**Action** - Explain in detail what action you took, your steps, and the rationale behind it:

_"Over a period of six months, I have implemented several initiatives, such as setting measurable sales targets for each individual, holding weekly sales meetings, and implementing a sales training program."_

**Result** - Talk about the outcome of your action in detail:

_"In the first quarter, we increased sales by 60% and exceeded sales targets by 25%. We continued to increase our sales throughout the next year."_
