## Introduction

Arrays hold values of the same type at contiguous memory locations. We're usually concerned about 2 things, position of the element and the element itself. Arrays are implemented differently under the hood across programming languages (Python arrays are dynamic)
**Advantages**
- Store multiple elements of same type with 1 variable name
- Accessing elements is fast if you have the index
**Disadvantages**
- Addition and removal of elements into/from middle of array is slow cause have to shift. Add/removing elements from end of array is fast
- Array size could be fixed, if element is added into full array, new array has to be allocated and existing elements copied over. This takes `O(n)` time

## Common terms

Common terms when doing array problems
- **Subarray**: Range of contiguous values within an array
	- Example: given array `[2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4]`, `[3,6,1]` is a subarray and `[3,1,5]` is not
- **Subsequence**: A sequence that can be derived by deleting some or no elements without changing the order
	- Example: given array `[2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4]`, `[3,1,5]` is a subsequence and `[3,5,1]` is not

## Time complexity

| Operation             | Big-O     | Note                                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access                | O(1)      |                                                                           |
| Search                | O(n)      |                                                                           |
| Search (sorted array) | O(log(n)) |                                                                           |
| Insert                | O(n)      | Insertion will require shifting all subsequent elements to the right by 1 |
| Insert (at the end)   | O(1)      | No other elements need to be shifted                                      |
| Remove                | O(n)      | Deletion will require shifting all subsequent elements to the left by 1   |
| Remove (at the end)   | O(1)      | Not other elements need to be shifted                                     |


## Things to Look out for during interviews
- Duplicate values in the array. Does this affect the answer? Does it make the question simpler or harder?
- Be careful not to go out of bounds indexing the array
- Be mindful about slicing or concatenating arrays. Typically would take `O(n)` time. Use start and end indices to demarcate a subarray/range where possible

## Corner Cases
- Empty sequence
- Sequence w/ 1 or 2 elements
- Sequence with repeated elements
- Duplicated values

## Techniques
Note that both arrays and strings are sequences so most techniques will apply to string problems as well
#### Sliding Window
In a sliding window, you have 2 pointers going in same direction that never overtake each other. This ensures each value is visited at most twice.
Time complexity: `O(n)`
Examples: [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/), [Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/), [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

Template:
```python
def findSubstring(s: str):
	n = len(s)
	char_map = {}
	counter = 0         # checks whether substring is valid
	left, right = 0, 0  # two pointers: tail and head
	min_len = 0         # length of substring

	for i in... # initialize hash map here

	while right < n:
		if char_map[s[right]] += 1 ... # modify counter here
		while #counter condition:
			# update min_len to find minimum
			# increment left ptr
			# modify counter
	return min_len
		
```
#### Two pointers
More general version of sliding window where pointers can cross each other and can be on different arrays
Examples: [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/), [Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)

When given 2 arrays to process, it is common to have 1 index per array to traverse/compare the both of them and incrementing the pointer when relevant.
Examples: [Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)
#### Traversing from the right
 Sometimes you can traverse the array from the right instead of conventionally the left.
Examples: [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/), [Number of Visible People in a Queue](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-visible-people-in-a-queue/)
#### Sorting the array
Is the array sorted or partially sorted? If it is, binary search is possible. Typically means interviewer is looking for something faster than `O(n)` 

Can you sort the array? Sometimes this might simplify the problem but would not work if order needs to be preserved
Examples: [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/), [Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

#### Precomputation
For questions where summation or multiplication of a subarray is involved, pre-computation using hashing or prefix/suffix sum/product might be useful
Examples: [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/), [Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/), [LeetCode questions tagged "prefix-sum"](https://leetcode.com/tag/prefix-sum/)
#### Index as a hash key
If interviewer asks for `O(1)` space, it might be possible to use the array itself as a hash table. Using the values themselves to access their index in the array
Examples: [First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/), [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)
#### Traversing the array more than once
Traversing the array twice/thrice is still `O(n)`. Sometimes traversing the array more than once will solve the problem while keeping same time complexity
