## Introduction
Sorting is act of rearranging elements in order either numerical or lexicographical order and either ascending or descending.

On sorted array of elements, by leveraging its sorted property, you can perform binary search to get a faster than O(n) search time with O(nlogn).

```python
def binary_search(sorted_arr, target):
	left, right = 0, len(sorted_arr)

	while left <= right:
		mid = (right-left) // 2 + left # to prevent int overflow. Though it's not a problem in python
		if sorted_arr[mid] == target:
			return mid
		elif sorted_arr[mid] < target:
			left = mid + 1
		else:
			right = mid - 1
	return -1
```

While you're unlikely to be asked to implement a sorting algorithm from scratch during an interview, it is good to know the various time complexities of the different sorting algorithms.

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Selection Sort:** 
	- O(n^2) sorting algorithm. In-place comparison based
	- list is divided into 2 parts, sorted part at left and unsorted part at right. The smallest element is selected from unsorted array and swapped with leftmost element, that element becomes part of sorted array. Left pointer increments by 1
- **Bubble Sort:**
	- O(n^2) comparison based algorithm
	- Compare each adjacent elements, if right > left element, swap them. Do this until all elements are sorted
- **Insertion Sort:**
	- O(n^2) in-place comparison based algorithm
	- A sublist is mainted to be sorted, an element is "inserted" into this sorted sublist. The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are swapped with items in sorted part of the array until its rightful position
- **Merge Sort:**
	- O(nlogn) divide and conquer technique
	- Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves, then combines them in sorted manner
	- Divide list recursively until it can't be divided (array of size 2). Swap the elements if they're not sorted. Merge the smallest lists into new list in sorted order

```
1. If it is only one element in the list, consider it already 
sorted, so return.
2. Divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no  
more be divided.
3. Merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.
```

```python
def mergeSort(array):
	if len(array) == 1:
		return
	midpoint = ...
	left_arr = ...
	right_arr = ...

	mergeSort(left_arr)
	mergeSort(right_arr)
	merge (left_arr, right_arr, array)

	return array

def merge(left_arr, right_arr, array):
	
```

	
- **Quick Sort:**
	- O()
	- Partitions the array into smaller arrays. Partitioned into 2 arrays one of which holds values smaller than a pivot (some specified value), and the other array holds values > than the pivot
```
1. make a value the pivot
2. partition the array using the pivot
3. quicksort left partition recursively
4. quicksort right partition recursively
```

```python
def partition(arr, low, high):
	i = low - 1
	pivot = arr[high]
	for j in range(low, high):
		if arr[j] <= pivot:
			i += 1
			arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i] # swap
	arr[i+1], arr[highi] = arr[high], arr[i+1]
	return i+1
	
def quickSort(arr, low, high):
   if low < high:
      pivot = partition(arr, low, high)
      quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1)
      quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high)
```

## Things to look out for during interviews
Make sure you know time and space complexity of the language's default sorting algorithm!
In Python, it's [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort). In Java, [an implementation of Timsort](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/d9052b946682d1c0f2629455d73fe4e6b95b29db/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/TimSort.java) is used for sorting objects, and [Dual-Pivot Quicksort](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/d9052b946682d1c0f2629455d73fe4e6b95b29db/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/DualPivotQuicksort.java) is used for sorting primitives.

Timsort is O(nlogn) worst case and average case. Best case is O(n). Worst case space complexity is O(n). Timesort is derived from merge sort and insertion sort. It finds subsequences of data that are already ordered and uses them to sort the remainder more efficiently. It iterates over data into runs and put thos runs on a stack. When the runs on the top of the stack match a merge criterion, they are merged. This goes on until all data is traversed, then, all runs are merged two at a time and only one sorted run remains.

Each run has a minimum size, if size of input is less than this, insertion sort is used to add more elements to the run until min run size is reached

## Corner cases
- Empty sequence
- Sequence with 1 element
- Sequence with 2 elements
- Sequence with duplicate elements

## Techniques
#### Sorted inputs
When a given sequence is in sorted order, using binary search should be one of the first things that come to mind
#### Sorting an input that has limited range
[Counting sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort) is a non-comparison based sort that you can use on numbers where you know the range of values beforehand. Examples: [H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)
