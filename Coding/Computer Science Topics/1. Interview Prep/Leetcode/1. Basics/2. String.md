## Introduction
A string is a sequence of characters. Many tips that apply to array also apply to strings.

Common data structures for looking up strings:
- [Trie/Prefix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
- [Suffix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree)
Common string algorithms:
- [Rabin Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) for efficient searching of substring using a rolling hash
- [KMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm) for efficient searching of substring
