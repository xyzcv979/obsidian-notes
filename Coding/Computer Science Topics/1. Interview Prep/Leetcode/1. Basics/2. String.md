## Introduction
A string is a sequence of characters. Many tips that apply to array also apply to strings.

Common data structures for looking up strings:
- [Trie/Prefix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
- [Suffix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree)
Common string algorithms:
- [Rabin Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) for efficient searching of substring using a rolling hash
- [KMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm) for efficient searching of substring

## Time Complexity
A string is an array of characters so operations are similar to array

| Operation | Big-O |
| --------- | ----- |
| Access    | O(1)  |
| Search    | O(n)  |
| Insert    | O(n)  |
| Remove    | O(n)  |

Operations involving another string:

| Operation                                    | Big-O  | Note                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Find substring                               | O(n*m) | Most naive case. More efficient algorithms for string searching such as KMP algorithm |
| Concatenating strings                        | O(n+m) |                                                                                       |
| Slice                                        | O(m)   |                                                                                       |
| Split (by token)                             | O(n+m) |                                                                                       |
| Strip (remove leading, trailing whitespaces) | O(n)   |                                                                                       |


## Things to look out for during interviews
Ask about case sensitivity and whitespace. Confirm the input language (typically Latin characters)

## Corner cases
- Empty string
- String with 1 or 2 characters
- String with repeated characters
- Strings with only distinct characters

## Techniques
#### Counting characters
Often you will need to count the frequency of characters in a string. Most common way is by using hash table/map or fixed array of 26 for lowercase characters. **Common mistake** is saying the space complexity is `O(n)` but it should be `O(1)` because the latin lowercase characters are fixed at 26 so the size of the counter does not increase

```python
freq_arr = [0 for i in range(26)]
for c in s:
	freq_arr[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
```

##### String of unique characters
A neat trick to count the characters in a string of unique characters is using a 26-bit bitmask to indicate which lower case latin characters are inside the string
```python
mask = 0
for c in word:
mask |= (1 << (ord(c) - ord('a')))
```
To determine if two strings have common characters, perform `&` on the two bitmasks. If result is non-zero, ie. `mask_a & mask_b > 0`, then the two strings have common characters
#### Anagram
An anagram is a word switch or word play. It is the result of rearranging the letters of a word to produce a new word.

To determine if two strings are anagrams, there are a few approaches:
- Sorting both strings should produce same string. This takes `O(nlog(n))` time and `O(log(n))` space
- Map each character to a prime number and multiple each mapped number together. Anagrams should have the same multiple (prime factor decomposition). Takes `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space
- Frequency counting of characters. Takes `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space
#### Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or other sequence which reads the same backward as forward, such as `madam` or `racecar`

Here are ways to determine if a string is a palindrome:
- Reverse the string and check if they're equal
- Have two pointers at start and end of the string. Move them if match until they meet.

Order of characters matter so hash tables are not helpful

When the question is about counting the number of palindromes, a **common trick** is to have two pointers that move outward, starting from the middle. 
Note that palindromes can be even or odd length. For each middle pivot position, you need to check twice - once that includes the character and once without the character. This is seen in [Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/).
- For substrings, you can terminate early once there is no match
- For subsequences, use dynamic programming as there are overlapping subproblems. Check out [Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)
