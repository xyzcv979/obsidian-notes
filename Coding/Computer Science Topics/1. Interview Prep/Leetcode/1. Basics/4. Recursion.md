## Introduction
Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem

All recursive functions must have the following:
1. **Base case**: this defines when the recursion is stopped, else it'll go on forever
2. Work towards the base case
3. **Recursive call** (calling itself)

Example of recursion: Fibonacci sequence
- Base case: `fib(0) = 0` and `fib(1) = 1`
- Recurrence relation: `fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2)`
```python
def fib(n):
	if n <= 1:
		return n
	return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

While a program runs, there is a **call stack** of function calls that have started but not yet returned. For recursive calls, the call stack pushes each function until they're returned in which the stack pops it out.

**Tail Recursion** is when a recursive function has the recursive call as the last statement that is executed, so that nothing is left to execute after the recursion. This is better than non-tail recursive functions because it is optimized by the compiler. This is because since the recursive call is the last statement, you don't need to store the function's stack frame as it's no longer needed.

tail-recursive function
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

non-tail-recursive function:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return factorial(n - 1) * n
```

## Things to look out for during interviews
- Always remember to define a base case to end the recursion
- Recursion is useful for permutation, because it generates all combinations and tree based questions. You should know how to generate all permutations and handle duplicates
- Recursion implicitly uses a stack. So, all recursion approaches can be rewritten iteratively using a stack. Beware of cases where recursion level goes too deep and cause stack overflow (python default limit is 1000). Recursion will never be O(1) space because it uses stack unless there is tail-call optimization (python doesn't)
- Number of bases cases - In the fibonacci sequence, you're invoking `fib(n-2)` and `fib(n-1)` so you need to handle 2 base cases to cover the possible invocations. If it only invoked one, you only need one base case

## Corner cases
- `n = 0`
- `n = 1`
- Make sure you have enough base cases to cover all possible invocations of the recursive function

## Techniques
#### Memoization
In some cases, you may be computing the result for previously computed inputs. For example, `fib` calls the same input multiple times. If you memoize the input, with a hash map usually, that improves performance, efficiency and the time complexity becomes `O(n)`
