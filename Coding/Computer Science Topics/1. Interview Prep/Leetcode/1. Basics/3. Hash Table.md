## Introduction
Hash table or hash map is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function on an element to compute the index, also called hash code, into an array of buckets/slots.

During lookups, the key is hashed and used to find the corresponding stored value

Hashing is the most common example of space-time tradeoff. Instead of linearly searching an array everytime, you can hash all the elements once into a hash table and looking it up takes O(1) average time

A good hash table must always have:
1. a hash function that is easy to compute
2. a hash function that avoids collisions
3. a hash function that returns the same key, every single time, for a given value
A simple hash function is taking size/value of the object and performing modulos by array size to get a valid array index

In the case of **collisions**, which occur when hash function generates the same index for more than one key, here are some collision resolution techniques
- **Separate chaining** - A linked list is used for each value, which stores all the collided values. Downside to chaining is that it takes more time to search with, potentially O(n) if you just get one long linked list. This shouldn't happen if hashing function does a good job of distributing the elements to prevent clustering like that.

- **Open addressing** - Collisions are resolved by probing, or searching through alternative locations in the array (the probe sequence like linear probing) until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates there is no such key in the table. Pretty much scans until an empty space, looping back to beginning if it has to. Downside to linear probing is the tendency for **clustering**, where the table isn't spaced out evenly (most of the items are grouped together)

## Time complexity

| Operation | Big-O | Note                                                 |
| --------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Access    | N/A   | Accessing not possible as the hash code is not known |
| Search    | O(1)  |                                                      |
| Insert    | O(1)  |                                                      |
| Remove    | O(1)  |                                                      |
Search, Insert, Remove are average case runtimes.
