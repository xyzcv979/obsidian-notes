## Introduction

Geometry is a branch of mathematics that is concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. Advanced geometry (e.g. 3D) is not taught in most CS courses so expect only 2D geometry

In interviews, geometry is usually not the focus of the problem, you typically have to use other data structures/algorithms in the problem
## Corner cases
- Zero values

## Techniques

### Distance between two points
When comparing the distance between two points, using dx2 + dy2 is sufficient. It is unnecessary to square root the value. Examples: [K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

### Overlapping circles
To find out if two circles overlap, check that the distance between the two centers of the circles is less than sum of their radii.

### Overlapping rectangles
Two rectangles overlap if the following is true:
```
overlap = rect_a.left < rect_b.right and \  
  rect_a.right > rect_b.left and \ 
  rect_a.top > rect_b.bottom and \  
  rect_a.bottom < rect_b.top
```

## Sample questions
- You have a plane with lots of rectangles on it, find out how many of them intersect
- Which data structure would you use to query the k-nearest points of a set on a 2D plane?
- Given many points, find k points that are closest to the origin
- How would you triangulate a polygon?
