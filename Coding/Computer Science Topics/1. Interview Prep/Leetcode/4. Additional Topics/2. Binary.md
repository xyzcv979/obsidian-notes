## Introduction

Knowledge of binary number system and bit manipulation is less important as most SWEs do not have to deal with bits. They are still asked sometimes, so make sure to know how to convert a number from decimal form into binary form (and vice versa).

```python
# convert decimal to binary
bin(num)

# convert binary to decimal
int(binary_num, 2)
```

## Corner cases
- Be aware and check for overflow/underflow
- Negative numbers

## Techniques

Some helpful utility snippets:

|Technique|Code|
|---|---|
|Test kth bit is set|`num & (1 << k) != 0`.|
|Set kth bit|`num \|= (1 << k)`|
|Turn off kth bit|`num &= ~(1 << k)`.|
|Toggle the kth bit|`num ^= (1 << k)`.|
|Multiply by 2k|`num << k`|
|Divide by 2k|`num >> k`|
|Check if a number is a power of 2|`(num & num - 1) == 0` or `(num & (-num)) == num`|
|Swapping two variables|`num1 ^= num2; num2 ^= num1; num1 ^= num2`|
