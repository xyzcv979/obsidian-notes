## Introduction

Math is a foundational aspect of CS and every programmer needs to have basic mathematical knowledge. 
## Things to look out for during interviews
- If code involves division or modulo9, remember to check for division or modulo by 0
- Check for and handle overflow/underflow if using typed languages like Java and C++. Mention overflow/underflow is possible and ask whether you need to handle it
- Consider negative numbers and floating point numbers.

## Corner Cases
- Division by 0
- Multiplication by 1
- Negative numbers
- Floats

## Common formulas

| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Check if a number is even    | `num % 2 == 0`                          |
| Sum of 1 to N                | 1 + 2 + ... + (N - 1) + N = (N+1) * N/2 |
| Sum of Geometric Progression | 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + ... 2n = 2n+1 - 1   |
| Permutations of N            | N! / (N-K)!                             |
| Combinations of N            | N! / (K! * (N-K)!)                      |

## Techniques 
### Multiples of a number
When a question involves "whether a number is a multiple of x", the modulo operator would be useful
### Comparing Floats
When dealing with floating point numbers, take note of rounding mistakes. Consider using epsilon comparisons instead of equality checks. E.g. `abs(x-y) <= 1e-6` instead of `x == y`
### Fast operators
If the question asks you to implement an operator such as power, square root, or division and want it to be faster than O(n), some sort of doubling (fast exponentiation) or halving (binary search) is usually the approach to go.
