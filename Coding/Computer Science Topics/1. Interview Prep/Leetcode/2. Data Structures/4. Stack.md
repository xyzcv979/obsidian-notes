## Implementations
|Language|API|
|---|---|
|C++|[`std::stack`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/stack-class)|
|Java|[`java.util.Stack`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html)|
|Python|Simulated using [List](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)|
|JavaScript|Simulated using [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)|

## Time complexity
|Operation|Big-O|
|---|---|
|Top/Peek|O(1)|
|Push|O(1)|
|Pop|O(1)|
|isEmpty|O(1)|
|Search|O(n)|

## Corner cases
- Empty stack. Popping from empty stack
- Stack with 1 item
- Stack with 2 items

## Notes:
Same with queue. Monotonic stack, either increasing or decreasing. Maintaining that property of the monotonic stack as you loop through a sequence. Monotonic stack technique is useful for finding index of previous lesser(or greater) and next lesser(or greater) element in linear time
