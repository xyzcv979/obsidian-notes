## Introduction
Interval questions are a subset of array questions where you are given an array of two-element arrays (an interval) and the two values represent start and end value. 

## Things to look out for during interviews
- Clarify with interviewer whether `[1,2]` and `[2,3]` are considered overlapping intervals as this affects the equality checks
- Clarify whether interval of `[a,b]` will strictly follow `a` < `b` (`a` is smaller than `b`)

## Corner cases
- No intervals
- Single interval
- Two intervals
- non-overlapping intervals
- An interval totally consumed within another interval
- Duplicate intervals (exactly the same start and end)
- Intervals which start right where another interval ends

## Techniques
### Sort the array of intervals by its starting point
Common routine for interval questions is to sort the array of intervals for each interval's starting value. 
### Checking if two intervals overlap
Be familiar with writing code to check if two intervals overlap

```python
def overlap(a, b):
	return a[0] < b[1] and b[0] < a[1]
```

### Merging two intervals
```python
def merge_overlapping_intervals(a, b):
	return [min(a[0],b[0]), max(a[1],b[1])]
```
