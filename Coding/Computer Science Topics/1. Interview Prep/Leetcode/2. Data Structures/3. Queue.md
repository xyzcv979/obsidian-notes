## Introduction
A queue is a linear collection of elements that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of elements at one end of the sequence (**enqueue** operation) and the removal of elements from the other end (**dequeue** operation). Usually, the end of the sequence where elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue and the other end is head or front of the queue. As an abstract data type, queues can be implemented using arrays or singly linked lists

This behavior is called **FIFO** (first in, first out). 

Breadth-first search is commonly implemented using queues.

## Implementations
|Language|API|
|---|---|
|C++|[`std::queue`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/queue-class)|
|Java|[`java.util.Queue`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html).Use [`java.util.ArrayDeque`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/ArrayDeque.html)|
|Python|[`queue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html)|
|JavaScript|N/A|
```python
q = queue.Queue()
q.put(item)
item = q.get() # remove and return the front item

# Block until all tasks are done.
q.join()
print('All work completed')
```

### Deque
Deques support appending and popping from both ends. O(1) performance in either direction

```python
deq = collections.deque()

deq.append(item)       # add new entry to right side
deq.appendleft(item2)  # add new entry to left side

deq.pop()              # return and remove rightmost item
deq.popleft()          # return and remove leftmost item
```
## Time complexity
| Operation     | Big-O |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Enqueue/Offer | O(1)  |
| Dequeue/Poll  | O(1)  |
| Front         | O(1)  |
| Back          | O(1)  |
| isEmpty       | O(1)  |

## Things to look out for during interviews
Most languages don't have a built-in Queue class which can be used and candidates often use arrays (Javascript) or lists (Python) as a queue. However, note that dequeue operation in such a scenario is O(n) time because you have to shift all elements left by one. 
## Corner cases
- Empty queue
- Queue with one item
- Queue with 2 items

## Notes:
Monotonic increasing/decreasing queue/stack
- Strictly increasing, decreasing. Use a loop to pop from the data structure until the conditions are met for monotonic increasing/decreasing
