## Introduction
A matrix is a 2-dimensional array. Questions revolving matrices are usually related to dynamic programming or graph traversal

## Corner Cases
- Empty matrix. Check that non of the arrays are 0 length
- 1 x 1 matrix
- Matrix with only one row or column

## Techniques
#### Creating an empty N x M matrix
For questions involving traversal or dynamic programming, you almost always want to make a copy of the matrix with the same size/dimensions that is initialized to empty values to store the visited state or DP table. Be familiar with such a routine in your language of choice

In python
```python
# Assumes that the matrix is non-empty  
zero_matrix = [[0 for _ in range(len(matrix[0]))] for _ in range(len(matrix))]
```
Copying a matrix in python
```python
copied_matrix = [row[:] for row in matrix]
```

#### Transposing a matrix
The transpose of a matrix is found by interchanging its rows into columns or columns into rows.

Many grid-based games can be modeled as a matrix such as tic-tac-toe, sudoku, crossword, connect4, battleship, etc. It is not uncommon to be asked to verify the winning condition of the game. For some games like tic-tac-toe and connect4, one where verification has to be done vertically and horizontally, one trick is to write code to verify the matrix for the horizontal cells, transpose the matrix, and reuse the same horizonal cell logic to verify the vertical cells (which are now horizontal)

Transposing a matrix in python:
```python
transposed_matrix = zip(*matrix)
```
Or:
```python
def transpose(matrix, transposed_matrix):
	for i in range(len(matrix)):
		for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
			transposed_matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i]
```
