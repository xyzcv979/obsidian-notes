## Introduction
A tree is an abstract data type that represents a hierarchical structure of a set of connected nodes. Each node in the tree can be connected to many children but must be connected to only 1 parent, except for root node, which has no parent

A tree is an undirected and connected acyclic graph. There are no cycles or loops

For the purpose of interviews, you will be asked on binary trees as opposed to ternary (3 children) or N-ary (N children) trees.

## Common terms you need to know
- **Neighbor** - Parent or child of a node
- **Ancestor** - A node reachable by traversing its parent chain
- **Descendant** - A node in the node's subtree
- **Degree** - Number of children of a node
- **Degree of a tree** - Maximum degree of nodes in the tree
- **Distance** - Number of edges along the shortest path between 2 nodes
- **Level/Depth** - Number of edges along the unique path between a node and the root node
- **Width** - Number of nodes in a level

### Binary Tree
Binary means 2, so nodes in binary tree have a maximum of 2 children
#### Binary tree terms
- **Complete Binary Tree** - Binary tree in which every level, except possibly last, is completely filled, and all nodes in last level are as far left as possible
- **Balanced Binary Tree** - Left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than one. Imagine a linked list looking binary tree, this is not balanced
#### Traversals
- In-order traversal - Left -> Root -> Right
- Pre-order traversal - Root -> Left -> Right
- Post-order traversal - Left -> Right -> Root
### Binary Search Tree
In-order traversal of BST will give you all elements in order.

Be familiar with the properties of a BST and validating  that a binary tree is a BST. (All elements in left subtree <= root and all elements in right subtree > root. To validate, check this)

#### Time complexity

| Operation | Big-O     |
| --------- | --------- |
| Access    | O(log(n)) |
| Search    | O(log(n)) |
| Insert    | O(log(n)) |
| Remove    | O(log(n)) |
Space complexity of traversing balanced trees is O(h) where h is the height of the tree, while traversing very skewed trees (like a linked list) will be O(n)

## Things to look out for during the interviews
Be very familiar with writing pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal recursively. As an extension, challenge yourself by writing them iteratively. Sometimes interviewers ask candidates for the iterative approach, especially if candidate finishes writing recursive approach too quickly

## Corner cases
- Empty tree
- Single node
- Two nodes
- Very skewed tree (like a linked list)

## Common routines
Be familiar with the following routines because many tree questions make use of one or more of these in the solution
- Insert value
- Delete value
- Count number of nodes in tree
- Whether a value is in the tree
- Calculate height of the tree
- Binary Search Tree
	- Determine if it is a binary search tree
	- Get max value
	- Get min value

## Techniques
#### Use Recursion
Recursion is most common approach for traversing trees. 
When using recursion, remember to check for base case when node is `null`
Sometimes it is possible that your recursive function needs to return two values
#### Traversing by level
When you are asked to traverse a tree by level, use breadth-first search
#### Summation of nodes
If the question involves summation of nodes along the way, be sure to check whether nodes can  be negative
