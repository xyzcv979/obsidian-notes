## Introduction
Tries are special trees (prefix trees) that make searching and storing strings more efficient. Tries have many practical applications like conducting searches and providing autocomplete. It is helpful to know these common application so that you can easily identify when a problem can be efficiently solved using a trie

Be familiar with implementing one from scratch, a `Trie` class and `add`, `remove`, and `search` methods.

## Time complexity

`m` is the length of the string used in the operation.

|Operation|Big-O|
|---|---|
|Search|O(m)|
|Insert|O(m)|
|Remove|O(m)|

## Corner Cases
- Searching for a string in an empty trie
- Inserting empty strings into a trie

## Techniques
Sometimes preprocessing a dictionary of words into a trie, will improve the efficiency of searching for a word of length k, among n words. Searching becomes O(k) instead of O(n)

#### Trie implementation (Python)
For each Trie node, keep track of the value, neighbors, and a boolean that marks if the word is at the end

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self, c=''):
        self.value = c
        self.neighbors = {}
        self.is_end = False

class Trie:

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        temp = self.root
        for i in range(len(word)):
            c = word[i]
            if c not in temp.neighbors:
                temp.neighbors[c] = TrieNode(c)
            temp = temp.neighbors[c]
            # mark last char of word
            if i == len(word) - 1:
                temp.is_end = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        temp = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in temp.neighbors:
                return False
            temp = temp.neighbors[c]
        return temp.is_end

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        temp = self.root
        for c in prefix:
            if c not in temp.neighbors:
                return False
            temp = temp.neighbors[c]
        return True

# Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Trie()
# obj.insert(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
# param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)
```
