## Introduction
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is a complete tree that satisfies the heap property.
- Max heap - Value of a node must be the greatest among the nodes in its entire subtree
- Min heap - value of a node must be the smallest among the node values in its subtree

In the context of algorithm interviews, heaps and priority queues can be treated as same data structure. A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with highest (or lowest) priority

|Operation|Big-O|
|---|---|
|Find max/min|O(1)|
|Insert|O(log(n))|
|Remove|O(log(n))|
|Heapify (create a heap out of given array of elements)|O(n)|

## Techniques
### Mention of k
If you see a top or lowest k being mentioned, it is usually heap related.

If you require the top k elements, use a min heap of size k. Iterate thru each element and push to heap, when heap exceeds size k, pop out min element. This guarantees you have k largest elements
