## Introduction
A graph is a structure containing a set of objects (nodes/vertices) where there can be edges between these nodes/vertices. Edges can be directed or undirected and can optionally have values (weights).

Graphs are commonly used to model relationship between unordered entities such as:
- Friendship between people - Each node is a person and edges between nodes represent that these two people are friends
- Distances between locations - Each node is a location and the edge between nodes represent these locations are connected. The value of the edge represents the distance

Be familiar with graph representations, graph search algorithms, and their time and space complexities

## Graph representations
You can be given a list of edges and you have to build your own graph from the edges to perform traversals on them
- Adjacency matrix
- Adjacency list
- Hash table of hash tables

In algorithm interviews, graphs are commonly given in the input as 2D matrix

## Time complexity
`|V|` is the number of vertices while `|E|` is the number of edges.

|Algorithm|Big-O|
|---|---|
|Depth-first search|O(\|V\| + \|E\|)|
|Breadth-first search|O(\|V\| + \|E\|)|
|Topological sort|O(\|V\| + \|E\|)|

## Things to look out for during interviews
- A tree-like diagram could very well be a graph that allows for cycles. You have to handle cycles and keep a set of visited nodes when traversing
- Ensure you are correctly keeping track of visited nodes and not visiting each node more than once.

## Corner Cases
- Empty graph
- Graph with 1 or 2 nodes
- Disconnected graphs
- Graph with cycles

## Graph search algorithms
- **Common** - BFS, DFS
- **Uncommon** - Topological sort, dijkstra's
- **Almost never** - Bellman-ford, floyd-warshall, prim's, kruskal's

## Graph traversals
### DFS
Graph traversal algorithm which explores along each branch as far as possible before backtracking. Can use recursion or stack.

```python
def dfs(matrix):
	if not matrix:
		return []

	rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
	visited = set()
	directions = ((0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0))

	def traverse(i, j):
		if i < 0 or j < 0 or i == rows or j == cols or (i,j) in visited:
			return
		visited.add((i,j))
		for dir in directions:
			traverse(i+dir[0], j+dir[1])

	for i in rows:
		for j in cols:
			traverse(i,j)
```

### BFS
Graph traversal algorithm which starts at a node and explores all neighbors of the node first, before exploring nodes at the next level. A queue is usually used to keep track of the nodes encountered but not yet explored

```python
def bfs(matrix):
	if not matrix:
		return []
		
	rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
	visited = set()
	directions = ((0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0))

	def traverse(i, j):
		que = collections.deque()

		que.append((i,j))
		while que:
			curr_i, curr_j = que.popleft()
			if curr_i < 0 or curr_i == rows or curr_j < 0 or curr_j == cols:
				continue
			if (curr_i, curr_j) not in visited:
				visited.add((curr_i,curr_j))
				# loop neighbors
				for dir in directions:
					que.append(curr_i+dir[0], curr_j+dir[1])

	for i in rows:
		for j in cols:
			traverse(i,j)
```

### Topological Sort
A topological sort or ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge `uv` from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. A topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node `v` is visited only after all its dependencies are visited

Topological sorting is most commonly used for scheduling a sequence of jobs or tasks which has dependencies on other jobs/tasks. There is an edge from x to y if job x must be completed before job y can be started

Another example is taking courses in school which have prerequisites

To achieve this sorting, you have to keep track of an indegrees array which keeps track of neighbors that point to this node. A queue is used to store all nodes with 0 indegrees, when you process these nodes, you check their neighbors to subtract the indegree of this current node and add any additional indegrees of 0 nodes to the queue. So you keep decrementing dependencies

```python
def graph_topo_sort(num_nodes, edges):
	nodes = {} # This uses hash table of hashtables for graph representation
	topo_order = []
	que = collections.deque()

	# initialize all nodes in nodes table
	for node_id in range(num_nodes):
		nodes[node_id] = {'in':0, 'out':set()} # store indegrees and outdegrees
	# Increment indegrees and add nodes to outdegrees
	for node_id, pre_id in edges:
		nodes[node_id]['in'] += 1
		nodes[pre_id]['out'].add(node_id)
	# push any 0 indegree nodes to que
	# These nodes have no dependencies and you can start with them to remove from their outdegrees
	for node_id in nodes:
		if node_id['in'] == 0:
			que.append(node_id)

	while que:
		node_id = que.pop()
		# decrement all neighbors of this node
		# Add any 0 indegree neighbors to queue
		for nei in nodes[node_id]['out']:
			nodes[nei]['in'] -= 1
			if nodes[nei]['in'] == 0:
				que.append(nei)
		# This node is processed, add to topo array
		topo_order.append(node_id)
	# if processed all nodes in topo array, return it
	return topo_order if len(topo_order) == num_nodes else None
```
## Graph algorithms for shortest path:
**dijkstras** - finds shortest path from source node to all other nodes
**bellman ford** - for negative weights
**floyd-warshall** - computes shortest path for ea. pair of nodes
  

### Dijkstras Algorithm:
The idea of dijkstra is setting the starting dist to every node from source node to infinity. Source distance starts at 0. Dijkstra's algorithm makes use of a min heap (priority queue) to greedily get the lowest distance. When processing a node from the min heap, loop thru its neighbors, check if distance of neighbor is > than distance of node + weight between neighbor and node. If so, update the new distance of the neighbor. This means we found a shorter path to get to the neighbor. Push this updated info back to min heap.

Repeat until you get Shortest Path Tree. 

```python
# This class represents a directed graph using
# adjacency list representation
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, V: int): # Constructor
        self.V = V
        self.adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]

    def addEdge(self, u: int, v: int, w: int):
        self.adj[u].append((v, w))
        self.adj[v].append((u, w))

    # Prints shortest paths from src to all other vertices
    def shortestPath(self, src: int):
        # Create a priority queue to store vertices that
        # are being preprocessed
        pq = []
        heapq.heappush(pq, (0, src))

        # Create a vector for distances and initialize all
        # distances as infinite (INF)
        dist = [float('inf')] * self.V
        dist[src] = 0

        while pq:
            # The first vertex in pair is the minimum distance
            # vertex, extract it from priority queue.
            # vertex label is stored in second of pair
            d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)

            # 'i' is used to get all adjacent vertices of a
            # vertex
            for v, weight in self.adj[u]:
                # If there is shorted path to v through u.
                if dist[v] > dist[u] + weight:
                    # Updating distance of v
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[v], v))

        # Print shortest distances stored in dist[]
        for i in range(self.V):
            print(f"{i} \t\t {dist[i]}")
