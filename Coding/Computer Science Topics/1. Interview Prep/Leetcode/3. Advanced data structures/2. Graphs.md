## General Graph Ideas:
- N nodes and N edges means the graph has a cycle. N nodes and N-1 edges is a graph with no cycles

## Graph algorithms for shortest path:
**dijkstras** - finds shortest path from source node to all other nodes
**bellman ford** - for negative weights
**floyd-warshall** - computes shortest path for ea. pair of nodes
  

**Dijkstras Algorithm**:
The idea of dijkstra is setting the starting dist to every node from source node to infinity.
Add them to univsited set
Loop neighbors, update their distance to min(node's curr dist, dist so far)
Once a node visited all of it's unvisited nodes, mark the node as visited, it is finalized. (Red color)

White (undiscovered) - Grey (discovered, updating its neighbors distances) - Red (visited all of its neighbors, mark as done)
